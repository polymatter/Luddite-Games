This is a standard web shop site, built from scratch for customisibility and as a learning exercise

Once deployed, it will be hosted at www.ludditegames.com selling Yu-Gi-Oh cards and accessories, although there is unlikely to be anything Yu-Gi-Oh or trading card specific in its implementation.

It will include full eCommerce facilities, probably with ActiveMerchant support, as well as integration with Paypal (and possibly Google checkout, Amazon checkout ...)

This is primarily a real business site selling actual product. However, I will take the opportunity to learn good RoR practice and expose myself to learning opportunities through this project.
